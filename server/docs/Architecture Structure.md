# JobConnect: Monolithic Architecture Structure

## Project Overview

JobConnect is a job search platform connecting job seekers with employers. The platform allows job seekers to create profiles, search jobs, and apply, while employers can post jobs, search for candidates, and manage applications.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js with Express
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Mongoose ODM)
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
- **API Documentation**: Swagger/OpenAPI
- **Testing**: Jest for unit and integration tests

## Core Features

1. **User Authentication**

   - Registration and login for job seekers and employers
   - Profile management
   - Role-based access control

2. **Jobs Module**

   - Job posting and management for employers
   - Job search with filtering options
   - Job recommendations

3. **Applications Module**

   - Application submission
   - Application tracking
   - Resume/CV management

4. **Messaging System**

   - Direct messaging between job seekers and employers
   - Notifications for new messages, applications, etc.

5. **Admin Panel**
   - User management
   - Content moderation
   - Analytics and reporting

## Database Schema

The application will use MongoDB with the following main collections:

- Users (with role discrimination for job seekers and employers)
- Jobs
- Applications
- Messages
- Notifications

## API Endpoints Structure

- `/api/auth` - Authentication endpoints
- `/api/users` - User management
- `/api/jobs` - Job posting and searching
- `/api/applications` - Application management
- `/api/messages` - Messaging system
- `/api/admin` - Admin functionality

## Development Phases

1. **Phase 1**: Core authentication and user management
2. **Phase 2**: Job posting and searching functionality
3. **Phase 3**: Application system
4. **Phase 4**: Messaging system
5. **Phase 5**: Admin features and analytics
6. **Phase 6**: Performance optimization and scaling

## Advantages of Monolithic Approach

- Simpler development process
- Easier debugging and testing
- Simplified deployment
- Single codebase for the entire application
- Reduced operational complexity

## Future Scaling Considerations

- Horizontal scaling with load balancers
- Database optimization and indexing
- Caching strategies
- Potential refactoring to microservices for specific modules as needed
